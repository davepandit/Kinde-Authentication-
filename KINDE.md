## Guide to setting up Kinde for Authentication

❤️Simply create a next js project

🎉Go to Kinde and Settings>>Applications>>Get the env variables

📰Go the Settings>>Application>>View Details>>Details>>Set some callback urls mentioned in the Kinde docs using nextjs(Not a mandatory step because I found out that they by default have that callback url there in the right place)

⚡npm i @kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs

🔥The rest of the steps are best mentioned in the Kinde docs page for Nextjs
